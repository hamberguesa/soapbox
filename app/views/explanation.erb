	  <p>All you need to do is make a "Splash" and every
		SoapBox user within your immediate vicinity will
		hear it. It's that simple.</p>
		<p>Whenever anyone else in your area makes a splash,
		you will receive it automatically without having to
		refresh your page.</p>
		<p>You can also reply to anyone's splashes and anyone can reply to yours.</p>
		<p>Last but not least, easy on the SPAM.</p>
